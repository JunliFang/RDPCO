# RDPCO
A matlab implementation of RDPCO algorithm in paper "The  Rate-Distortion-Perception-Classification Tradeoff: Joint Source Coding and Modulation via Inverse-Domain GANs".

# Progress
- [x] RDPCO_algorithm1 : the main function of RDPCO algorithm
- [x] inner_point_RDPCO_m1 : optimizing noise matrix
- [x] generalize_inv : generalize inversion for item in classification error
- [x] designED : optimizing encoder and decoder matrix
